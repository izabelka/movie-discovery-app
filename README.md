My solution for a coding challenge.
The assignment was to create a movie discovery web app using [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to run the app
- Clone this repository
- In the cloned repository directory run the command:
`npm install`
(if you don't have npm installed, [get npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))
- run servers:
`npm run dev`
